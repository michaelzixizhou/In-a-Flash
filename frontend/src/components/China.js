            blood vessel walls and tissues to locate the site of an infection.

            White blood cell formation occurs in the soft tissue inside of your
            bones (bone marrow). Two types of white blood cells (lymphocytes)
            grow in the thymus gland (T cells) and lymph nodes and spleen (B
            cells).

            White blood cells originate from cells that morph into other cells
            in the body (stem cell) within the soft tissue of your bones (bone
            marrow).
